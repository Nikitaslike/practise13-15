        <div class="rectangle">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a super useful technology that is transforming various industries. It
                helps
                in automating tasks, improving decision-making, and enhancing user experiences. AI is used in
                applications
                such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, making our lives more
                efficient
                and convenient.</p>
            <!-- To make it more readable, use Shift + Option + F on a Mac (it formats text)-->
            <p>But you should notice that AI isn't able to replace jobs such as programmers because AI has only
                a stereotypical view, while real people have fantastic imagination and analytical skills.</p>
